So this post will somewhere explain you what will this site do and help you in what ways. So let's start with introduction to our own cyber-blogs.

So this site is made to help people getting great tricks for internet, that you can use for learning new things and also to make your life more easy.

So i will be uploading tricks as soon as i discover them, some latest courses that are paid on internet or can only be found on torrent sites, whose downloads are much slower and may give our computer viruses. On my site, whether it is a latest course or a course uploaded years ago, link will redirect you to the google drive or some cloud sites which give fastest download speed.

the first i will be starting with web dev then i am gonna move to some more interesting courses and many more.

just stay connected, love you guys!!
